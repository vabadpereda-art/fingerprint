FUNCTION NAME:	dump_image()

AUTHOR:			Joseph C. Konczal

DESCRIPTION:	Print image characteristics on stdout and create an
				image window displaying the image.

	INPUT:
		name			- A unique name used to label the image information
						printed on stdout and the window displaying the image
		img				- A pointer to the image to display
	    autosize		- A flag for turning autosizing of window on and off
        verbose			- A flag for turning printf's on and off

	OUTPUT:
		name			- An image window containing the given image (img)

FUNCTION NAME:	sivv()

AUTHOR:			John D. Grantham

DESCRIPTION:	Performs the entire standard SIVV process, described in NISTIR
				7599, on a given image, using either default (see overload 
				below) or given parameters


	INPUT:
		img				- An image to be processed by SIVV
		window			- A flag for turning on/off the windowing step in the
						SIVV process
		smoothscale		- A flag for setting the number of points to be used
						in the signal smoothing algorithm (see the
						smooth_sums() function definition above)
		verbose			- A flag for turning on/off "verbose" mode, useful for
						debugging the SIVV process
		textonly		- A flag for turning on/off the "textonly mode", which 
						determines whether the output is displayed graphically
						or as text only

	OUTPUT:
		return			- A string containing the results of the SIVV process,
						separated by commas in the following order:
							(1) Number of peak-valley-pairs (PVP's) found
							(2) Ordinal number of largest PVP found
							(3) Power difference between the valley and peak
							(4) Frequency difference between the valley and peak
							(5) Slope between the valley and peak
							(6) Frequency of the midpoint between the valley
								and peak

	OUTPUT:
		return			- A boolean value indicating whether or not the strings
						are equal (returns true if strings are equal)
